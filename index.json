Dagger is a vast universe and learning something new every day motivates me to revisit my code and think of ways to refactor it and make it clean. One such effort is to exploit Dagger’s Multi-binding feature to refactor the typical ‘View Holder’ class in Android.

Dagger offers Multibinding as a way out of this and quoting the Google’s definition of Multibinding: “Dagger allows you to bind several objects into a collection even when the objects are bound in different modules using Multibindings. Dagger assembles the collection so that application code can inject it without depending directly on the individual bindings” For our scenario, We would be creating a Map with the Key being the contact-type enum (Namely WhatsApp, Facebook etc) and the value being the corresponding ViewHolderWrapper class. (Why it’s a wrapper and not the corresponding ViewHolder will be explained ahead) The @IntoMap Keyword used along with the annotations IntKey, StringKey etc (for the respective datatype of the Value.) Refer:https://dagger.dev/api/latest/dagger/multibindings/package-summary.html for the Multibinding API list.
